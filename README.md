# Assignment_Modulr

1. Please use Chrome version 102.XX
2. Please RUN from the Login.feature file ( I have created runner file but it is not running thru runner file) (Assignment_Modulr/Assignment_Modulr/Featurefiles/)
3. You have to use user name as given in the code (not parameterised)
4. Password is auto generated for resetting the password. no manual intervension is required.
5. I would check if the runner file works. I have spent time investigating it but found no luck. I would give some time and come back it with fresh eyes.
